Changes made after end of review session
- rewrote package.json scripts (cuz I can)
- added seedData function to mysql/bin/seedData.js
- fixed an syntax error in mysql/model.js (i'll let you find out what it is)
- changed how we required mysql models in server/index.js, because we were already had a variable named 'todo' in the delete function

Success Tips:
- rebuild the entire todo list without looking at this code
- if stuck, use official docs and stack overflow
- if still stuck and you HAVE to look at this code, look at it then restart the entire todo list from scratch
- repeat until you can rebuild this 2-3 times without looking at this code
